Someone didn't lock their Workstation? Let them subtly know they should lock it when they leave it. Paste the above command in a terminal and their desktop background will be changed to a beautiful Pink Pony wallpaper. No terminal? Use the below buttons to tweet/post/plus the Pony love using their social media accounts. 

## Ponify Rules

1. Someone is not at their workstation and it is unlocked
2. Ponify them with the script or the social media buttons
2. Take a photo of the Ponified workstation or Social Media Account
2. Share the photo in your company
2. Educate the person on the importance of locking their workstation

Ponify.nl is tested on Mac OS X 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9. It also works on Ubuntu 12.04.
